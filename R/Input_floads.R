#' @title This function specifies factor loading values.
#' @description The user specifies the factor loadings as a matrix. The values should be given by column for each factor.
#' Columns represent factors and rows represent items.
#' The values entered should be larger than 0 and smaller then 1.
#' Please see the example for a loading matrix for three-factor model.
#' @author Fatih Or√ßan
#' @param nf the number of factor/s.
#' @param fl.loads vector of factor loadings
#' @return The function returns factor loading matrix. The number of column shows the number of factor in the model. The rows show number of items

#' # This example represents a three-factor CFA model
#' #  where the factors are indicated by 3, 3 and 2 items respectively.
