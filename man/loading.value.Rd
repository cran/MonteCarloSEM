\title{This function specifies the factor loading values.}
\usage{
loading.value(nf, fl.loads)
}
\arguments{
\item{nf}{the number of factor/s.}

\item{fl.loads}{vector of factor loadings}
}
\value{
The function returns the factor loading matrix. The number of columns shows the number of factors in the model. The rows show the number of items
}
\description{
The user specifies the factor loadings as a matrix. The values should be given by column for each factor.
Columns represent factors and rows represent items.
The values entered should be larger than 0 and smaller than 1.
Please see the example for a loading matrix for a three-factor model.
